# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-USING-ML-IN-PYTHON
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset of credit card transactions, and it predicts the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample credit card transaction dataset, which includes features such as:

-> Transaction amount

-> Transaction time

-> Card type

-> Country

-> Fraud label (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)

Model

The model used in this project is a logistic regression model, which is a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification problems. The model is trained on the dataset using scikit-learn library in Python.

Features

The following features are used in the model:

-> Transaction amount

-> Transaction time

-> Card type

-> Country

Performance Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

-> Accuracy

-> Precision

-> Recall

-> F1-score

-> ROC-AUC score

Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 96.55% on the test dataset, along with an accuracy of 98.70% on training dataset.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for credit card fraud detection. The logistic regression model achieved a high accuracy, indicating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Future Work

-> Collect more data to improve the model's performance

-> Experiment with other machine learning algorithms and techniques

-> Deploy the model in a production-ready environment
